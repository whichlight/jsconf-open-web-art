my jsconf talk, built with reveal.js. http://2014.jsconf.us/

[you can see the presentation
here](http://whichlight.github.io/jsconf-open-web-art/#/)
It has lots of images and things so will take a bit to load.

This [set of links](https://gist.github.com/whichlight/1cfd5cb8c3be960a486d) was
tweeted to the jsconf participants just before the talk.
